### Project Description
SNACKER is a Flutter app where you swipe and search for food: it pulls high-quality images from Unsplash and uses Google Gemini to generate playful, bite-sized descriptions.
It reacts to your face in real time‚Äîdetecting mouth-open events‚Äîand overlays fun AR effects.
Optionally, it can drop in 3D food models that animate (‚Äúget eaten‚Äù) when you open your mouth.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Often times people crave food but aren't in the circumstances to afford it. This app attempts to alleviate their suffering by fulfilling their mental hunger and not their physical hunger.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The app shows you food that you crave and keeps you hooked till you find a food you like. On liking a food , we are redirected to a new page where we can see ourselves eat the food through our selfie camera and AR. In this manner you feel like you actually ate the food.

### Project Demo
# Video

The video shows the application allowing us to swipe and select a food . On selecting a food, it uses AR to superimpose the food on our head and by tracking our mouth movement the food disappears.
